This is an erlier stage of the code for my portfolio www.jakobkitzing.com

The code is made with react/next.js.

The code is still a bit of a mess. I had to change from module Css styling to styling with emotions instead in some places. This change was made to make the transitions between the pages work when the project was build for ssr. I hope I will get the time to clean it up soon.

Hope you like my portfolio :)
